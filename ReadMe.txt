This is an Assembly Level Program (.asm) which takes a string as input and provides 4 options for the users
1. to find the string length - prints the number of characters in the string
2. to put to lower case - prints the string in lower case (regardless of the case of the input string)
3. to delete characters - asks for user input to specify the position of characters to be deleted and removes those characters.
4. Quit - Exits the console
